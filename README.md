Hi there! I'm a DevOps and Cloud Computing enthusiast with a passion for building efficient and scalable systems. 🌐💻 With hands-on experience in managing cloud infrastructures across AWS, Google Cloud, and OpenStack, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and streamlining processes.

Currently, I serve as the GDSC on Campus Lead at IEC College, where I inspire fellow students to explore the latest in tech. 🎓✨ I organize workshops, hackathons, and info sessions, including the exciting Gen AI Study Jam. My goal is to create an inclusive environment where everyone can learn and grow in the tech space.

As the founder of Abhiyantrik, I’m committed to promoting STEM education and advocating for diversity within the tech community. 🌈🤝 Through various initiatives and events, I empower students to embrace technology and pursue their passions.

When I’m not coding or organizing events, you can find me writing technical content on cloud computing and DevOps tools. ✍️📚 I love sharing insights and helping others navigate their tech journeys. I’m also an avid learner, constantly exploring new technologies and best practices in the ever-evolving field of DevOps.

Let’s connect! I’m always open to collaborating on exciting projects, sharing knowledge, or discussing innovative ideas. 🚀💬
